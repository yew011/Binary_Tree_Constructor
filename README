Base (Abstract) Class => Binary_Tree,
--- member variable:
    - the number of levels,
    - the number of nodes, only valid for complete tree,
    - the selection option: level_node_
    - the complete flag, bool type
    - the tree_root_, not allowed to be set by user

--- member function:
    - virtual function => construct_, return the pointer to the node
    - virtual function => print the tree, (maybe)


Ordinary_Binary_Tree : Binary_Tree
--- member variable:
    - none

--- member function:
    - construct_, return the pointer to the node,
      fill in the node value, like binary tree hashing,
    - virtual function => print the tree, (maybe)
      not implemented,

Binary_Search_Tree : Binary_Tree
--- member variable:
    - none

--- member function:
    - construct_, return the pointer to the node,
      fill in the node value, based on the BST order,
      need to consider the case, of incomplete tree,
    - virtual function => print the tree, (maybe)
      not implemented,
    - explicit destructor required to clean up the mess,
